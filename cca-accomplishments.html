        </div>
        <h4>World Robot Olympiad (WRO) – Future Innovators Category</h4>
        <p>I took part in the WRO 2024 – Future Innovators category, where we conceptualized and presented a tech-based solution to address a real-world issue. My team focused on integrating IoT and AI concepts to support smart community initiatives. Although we did not place, we gained invaluable experience in creative problem-solving, project presentation, and working collaboratively across different tech stacks.</p>
        <h4>Blaze Your Own Trail</h4>
        <p>I participated in Blaze Your Own Trail, a school-wide innovation and entrepreneurship event that challenged students to create solutions with real impact. I worked with a group to design a mobile app prototype to support digital wellness for students. This project helped me connect tech with empathy, user needs, and thoughtful design.</p>
        <h4>PLD (Personal Learning Device) Ambassador</h4>
        <p>In 2024, I was appointed as a Personal Learning Device (PLD) Ambassador, a leadership role that involved assisting peers and teachers with digital learning platforms and device-related issues. I conducted short tutorials, helped troubleshoot tech problems, and played a key part in promoting responsible and effective tech use across classrooms. This role enhanced my leadership, patience, and communication skills—especially when guiding peers with varying levels of digital literacy.</p>
        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>2024 was a pivotal year in my CCA journey. I demonstrated a high level of commitment to tech innovation, collaboration, leadership, and school representation through multiple platforms. These experiences helped deepen my skills in computing while also strengthening my ability to lead, adapt, and serve others—both technically and personally.</p>

        <h2>2025 – Secondary 4</h2>
        <h3>CCA: Infocomm Club – Senior Member & School Representative</h3>
        <p>In 2025, I continued to excel in the Infocomm Club, taking on more technically demanding roles and representing my school in national-level STEM events. My focus this year was on innovation, applied programming, and contributing meaningfully to my class and school community.</p>
        <h4>First Lego League (FLL) 2025 – School Representation</h4>
        <p>I represented my school in the First Lego League (FLL) 2025, a prestigious robotics and innovation challenge that combines coding, engineering, and real-world problem-solving. As part of the programming and design team, I worked on creating autonomous Lego robots using EV3/Spike Prime and developed code to complete mission-based challenges.<br>
        The project theme focused on sustainable cities, and we integrated environmental sensors to enhance our robot’s decision-making process. This experience pushed me to think deeply about both hardware and software integration, while learning to collaborate under high expectations and tight deadlines.</p>
